#  NOTE: See extlib/readme.txt
#
# notest : this dist fails tests, so --notest is required. Use the failing
#          distribution path as the value of this key. 'path' will cause
#          the dist to be pinned, and that's not necessary for failing tests
# force : this dist must use --force to install
# local : this is a local-only distribution, not on CPAN
# patched: we've patched this from the CPAN version
# (pinned): a 'path' without 'local' or 'patched'
#
# Local packages (not on CPAN) and patched packages MUST have a 'path',
# otherwise cpanm will not install the .meta for it and they will not
# be indexed.
#
# If you add a package in order to fix some other package's lack of
# of prereq resolution, please comment that here, since that issue
# may be fixed in the future.
#
# PLEASE prefix any pins or forces with a little comment/blurb with the
# rationale.  e.g. 'notest because of failing pod tests in x.yz' or 'see
# commit message for r12345'.  Links to RT/GH issues, cpantesters,
# pull-requests and the like are fantastic.  When this file is swept for cleanup
# having this information readily available makes the process significantly easier.
#
# If the issue is external and appropriate, PLEASE open a ticket upstream
# with the distribution.  You will thank yourself later.  Everyone else
# reading this will thank you now.
